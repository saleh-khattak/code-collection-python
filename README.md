# Python Practice: Strings, Lists, and Tuples

This repository contains Python practice programs covering **Chapter 3 (Strings)** and **Chapter 4 (Lists and Tuples)** and **Chapter 8 (Function and Recursion) based on the topics from the course/code with harry.

## ðŸ“š Chapters Covered
- **Chapter 3: Strings**  
  Concepts include:
  - String initialization
  - Escape characters
  - String functions (e.g., `replace()`)
  - Detecting double spaces
  - Using `f-strings` for formatting

- **Chapter 4: Lists and Tuples**  
  Concepts include:
  - Creating and modifying lists
  - Using `input()` with lists
  - Sorting lists
  - Tuples vs Lists
  - Counting elements in tuples
  - Summing elements in tuples

Chepter #8 FUNCTION AND RECURSION
# Python Basics â€“ Functions Practice (Day Project)

This mini project repository includes several beginner-level Python programs focused on **functions**. These projects help reinforce the concept of defining and using functions to perform specific tasks in Python.

## âœ… Topics Covered
- Function creation and usage
- User input handling
- Simple arithmetic operations
- Conditional statements
- Loops (used in patterns and tables)

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Included
1. **Inch to Centimeter Converter**  
   Converts user input from inches to centimeters using a function.

2. **Multiplication Table Generator**  
   Displays a multiplication table for a number using a loop and function.

3. **Pattern Printing**  
   Prints a simple star or number pattern using nested loops in a function.

4. **Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter**  
   Converts temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius using a formula and function.

5. **Find Greater Number**  
   Compares two numbers and returns the greater one.

6. **Sum of First N Natural Numbers**  
   Calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers using a loop inside a function.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python (Functions, Loops, Input/Output)

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed. Run any file using:
```bash
python filename.py


## âœ… Status
All scripts are tested and working correctly. Great for practice and learning purposes.
